# 🔧 Auto Workshop Web & Mobile UI — Designed with Flutter

A meticulously crafted **Flutter UI/UX design** project for an Auto Workshop — built to visually represent the workshop's technical excellence, creativity, and legacy through **distinct mobile and web designs**.

---

## 🧩 Project Brief

> **Client Goal:**  
Deliver a compelling and clean user interface for an Auto Workshop that reflects its professional identity and showcases its work, while staying within a predefined color palette.

> **My Role:**  
I was asked to bring in creative freedom within constraints — to design *differently for mobile and web*, ensuring the layout, flow, and design choices suit the respective platforms while conveying the same brand message.

## 🌐 Web vs Mobile Design Philosophy

| 📱 Mobile UI | 🖥️ Web UI |
|-------------|-----------|
| Intricately organized layout that condenses core workshop info into a seamless scroll | A bold, cinematic gallery layout that feels like flipping through a film reel |
| Visual storytelling via a **timeline-based portfolio** | Portfolio presented as a **vertical filmstrip** — multiple rows of work |
| Optimized for clarity, ease of use, and aesthetic balance | Prioritized visual immersion, breathing room, and larger imagery |

## 🎨 Key Highlights

- 🎯 **Creative freedom executed within brand palette**
- ✨ **Screens for both mobile and web versions**
- 📸 **Portfolio showcased via timeline (mobile) and gallery filmstrip (web)**

## 🚀 Built With

- **Flutter** – UI toolkit for crafting natively compiled apps
- **Dart** – Programming language behind Flutter
- **Figma** *(Initial designs planned out here before development)*

## 📝 What I Learned

- Balancing creative freedom with branding constraints
- Designing responsively for different screen types
- Structuring a UI to reflect identity, not just information
- Leveraging Flutter’s widget system for complex yet performant UIs

## 💭 Final Thoughts

This project wasn't just about screens — it was about storytelling through design. The challenge of bringing **the personality of a garage** into **pixels and patterns** was an incredibly rewarding design exercise. More than a website — this is **an experience**.
